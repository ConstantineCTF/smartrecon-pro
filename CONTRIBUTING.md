# Helping with SmartRecon Pro

Hey! I’m Constantine, and I’d love your help making my tool better!

1. Copy my project (fork it on GitHub).
2. Add new stuff to the `plugins/` folder.
3. Test it with `pytest`.
4. Send me your changes (pull request).

## Rules
- Write clean code.
- Add tests so it doesn’t break.
